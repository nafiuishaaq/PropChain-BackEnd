# RBAC Endpoint Permission Matrix

This document provides a comprehensive overview of role-based access control (RBAC) for all protected endpoints in the PropChain backend API.

## User Roles

- **USER**: Default role for registered users. Can manage their own profile, properties, and transactions.
- **AGENT**: Can manage properties and assist with transactions. Has elevated permissions for property management.
- **ADMIN**: Full system access including user management, property administration, fraud detection, and system configuration.

## Implementation Details

### Role Decorator Usage

Protected endpoints use the `@Roles()` decorator in combination with `@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, RolesGuard)`:

```typescript
@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, RolesGuard)
@Roles(UserRole.ADMIN)
@Get('admin/users')
getAllUsers() {
  // Only admins can access
}
```

### Multiple Roles

Some endpoints allow multiple roles:

```typescript
@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, RolesGuard)
@Roles(UserRole.AGENT, UserRole.ADMIN)
@Post(':id')
updateProperty() {
  // Both AGENT and ADMIN can access
}
```

### Public Endpoints

Endpoints without `@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard)` are public and accessible to all users (authenticated and unauthenticated).

### Self-Service vs Admin Access

Some endpoints have conditional access based on ownership:
- **Self-Service**: Users can access their own data
- **Admin Access**: Admins can access any user's data

This is typically implemented with additional logic in the controller or service layer.

## Security Best Practices

1. **Always validate roles on the server side** - Never rely on client-side checks
2. **Use the most restrictive role necessary** - Apply the principle of least privilege
3. **Audit role changes** - Log all role modifications for security auditing
4. **Regular permission reviews** - Periodically review and update role permissions
5. **Document role changes** - Keep this matrix updated when adding new endpoints

## Testing RBAC

When testing RBAC:
1. Test with each role (USER, AGENT, ADMIN)
2. Verify unauthorized access returns 403 Forbidden
3. Verify unauthenticated access returns 401 Unauthorized
4. Test edge cases (ownership checks, conditional permissions)

## Future Enhancements

- Consider adding more granular permissions (e.g., separate READ and WRITE permissions)
- Implement resource-level permissions for fine-grained access control
- Add permission groups for easier management of related permissions
- Consider adding a SUPER_ADMIN role for system-level operations
